	The Common Language Runtime (CLR) is a virtual machine that manages the execution of .NET applications. When programs are written in .NET languages they compile into Common Intermediate Language (CIL), which the CLR then translates into machine code for the processor to execute. A major benefit of the CLR is that it allows components written in different programming languages to work together in a consistent environment. It also provides additional services like memory management and security to make the development process easier.
